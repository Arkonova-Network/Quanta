## 📦 About Quanta

**Quanta** is a privacy-first network that enables secure and seamless communication between users and applications. Designed to support modern platforms, Quanta ensures encrypted message exchange, data integrity, and user transparency—all through a lightweight, browser-based frontend.

This repository presents the **frontend layer** of Quanta: visual interfaces and client-side activation logic for initializing communication and encryption processes. The exposed components serve as a transparency layer, demonstrating public-facing behavior without revealing proprietary internals.

> **Note:** This is a minimal, intentionally simplified implementation. It contains limited-capability stubs to safeguard intellectual property and system integrity.
